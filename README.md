# Why is this course on GitHub?

This [website](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io) and course is hosted by GitHub classroom which:

- provides private repositories for students,
- provides shared repositories for groups of students, and
- enables the instructor to share course materials in a public setting.

More importantly, if you are an interaction designer, you need to learn to work comfortably in  collaborative, distributed revision control systems (such as GitHub). This is because you are expected to function as a member of a development team. While this course has no group projects,  assignments are explicitly designed to encourage sharing and collaboration.

Ordinarily, git might be considered too complex to learn within a single class session. But because GitHub is web-based, it supports a high level of accessibility -- such that non-coders can work entirely within the browser, if desired. It also provides many of the collaborative tools needed in order to support topical conversation and collaboration between students.
