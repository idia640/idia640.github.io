{% include pdf.html %}
How can you as an interaction designer positively affect what a user thinks and does?  This course will introduce you to a range of concepts, theories, and empirical methods from social psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, and neurobiology. These theoretical underpinnings will enable you to better predict under what conditions user confusion or miscommunication may occur and potential strategies for repair. They will also provide you foundational tools for creating more positive and persuasive interactions.

Overarching questions we will address together:

1. How can you use knowledge of how people process information to design more usable interfaces?
2. How can you use knowledge of how people communicate to design less confusing interactions?
3. How can you use knowledge of how people think to guide behavior?

Some beliefs we will examine closely include:

- We believe our senses (what we see, is what we believe)
- We believe we are rational beings
- We believe our thinking is largely conscious
- We believe what we say to be largely unambiguous
- We believe we make our own decisions

We will question these basic beliefs and show how they sometimes get us into trouble in communications design -- and also how we can use them to advantage.

# <a name="req"></a> Course Requirements

**Weekly Reading and Writing Assignments:** Each week will include one or more readings of a topical nature. Students are expected to compose a short journal entry on that topic. *45% (5 points each, 1 point deducted for each day late)*

**Critical Review:** Each student will write a short, critical review of a scientific article. A list of articles to choose from will be provided. *(10 points/percent. 1 point deducted for each day late)*

**Presentation (Critical Review):** During the course of the semester, each student will present her/his critical review to the class and lead a discussion. *(5 points/percent)*

**Case Study:** Each student is required to complete a course project and present that project to peers at the end of course. The project is a case study with a focus on persuasive design. *(30 points/percent)*

**Participation:** Class participation on Slack and via Zoom. Excessive absence without pre-coordination will result in lost points. *(10 points/percent)*

# <a name="obj"></a> Course Objectives

Students will be able to:

1. Critically review scientific papers and communicate key findings to peers.
2. Communicate how theories of cognition and information processing apply to the design of interactive media.
3. Understand when and how to apply key research methodologies used in the study of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
4. In the form of a case study, create a persuasive design and discuss the science behind it.
5. Propose and describe methods for testing a hypothesis centered on behavior change in interaction design.
